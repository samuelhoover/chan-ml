# chan-ml

Execute `./run_chan-ML.sh` on the commmand line to start. Make sure your `gen_args.txt`, `train_args.txt`, and `predict_args.txt` argument files are configured correctly before beginning.

May need to execute `chmod +x run_chan-ML.sh` from `chan-ml` directory to change file permissions and make Bash script executable.
